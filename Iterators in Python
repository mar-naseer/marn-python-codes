Introduction to Python Iterators:

In Python, an iterator is an object that can be iterated (looped) upon. An iterator returns one element at a time from a sequence, like a list, tuple, or string. Understanding iterators and how to create them is essential for writing efficient and Pythonic code.
This tutorial focuses on creating and using “iterators” through examples, with explanations provided after each example.

Example 1: Using Built-In Iterators

Python has several built-in data types that support iteration, such as lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. 
These objects are iterable, meaning they can return an iterator using the iter() function.

This example demonstrates how to convert a list into an iterator and manually iterate through it using the next() function. 
It highlights the basics of using Python’s built-in iterators.


Code:

# A list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Get an iterator from the list
numbers_iter = iter(numbers)

# Iterate through the iterator using the next() function
print(next(numbers_iter))  # Output: 1
print(next(numbers_iter))  # Output: 2
print(next(numbers_iter))  # Output: 3
print(next(numbers_iter))  # Output: 4
print(next(numbers_iter))  # Output: 5

# If we call next() again, it will raise StopIteration
# print(next(numbers_iter))  # Uncommenting this line will raise StopIteration
Explanation:

'iter()' Function: Converts an iterable (like a list) into an iterator.

'next()' Function: Retrieves the next item from the iterator.

StopIteration: When the iterator is exhausted (no more items), calling 'next()' raises a 'StopIteration' exception.
