Find the Minimum Difference Between the Index of Two Given Elements Present in an Array in Python
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Input:

given list =[7, 9, 6, 8, 7, 5, 9, 4, 3, 2, 11, 19, 23, 4, 5, 8, 6, 3 ,2, 9, 7,]
given first element =7
given second element =8
Output:

The minimum difference between the elements 7 and 8 = 1
