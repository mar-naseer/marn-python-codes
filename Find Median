Python Program to Find Median of List=


gvn_list = [5, 2, 4, 2, 1]
gvn_list.sort()
lst_leng = len(gvn_list)
# Find the middle element of the given List by using (total length of list-1)
# divided by 2( zero indexing)and store it in a variable.
mid_vlu = (lst_leng-1)//2

# Check if the given list is even or odd using the If conditional statement.
if(lst_leng % 2 == 0):
    # If the length of given list is even , median is the average of middle two elements.
    res_vlu = (gvn_list[mid_vlu] + gvn_list[mid_vlu+1])/2
else:
    # If the length of given list is odd , Median  is the middle element.
    res_vlu = gvn_list[mid_vlu]
print('The Median of the Given List of Elements =', res_vlu)

Output:

The Median of the Given List of Elements = 2
